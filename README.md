## Programming language used: Python

### Breif description :
Problem 1: Calculator
Functionality: Implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Input: Two floating-point numbers (a, b) and a string indicating the type of operation.
Output: The result of the operation, or an error message for invalid inputs or division by zero.
Implementation: Defined as a class Calculator with an initializer for inputs and a calculate() method to process operations.

Problem 2: Odd Number Series
Functionality: Generates a series of odd numbers up to the given input.
Input: A single integer (a).
Output: A list of odd numbers, with a determining the length of the sequence.
Implementation: The function generate_odd_series() calculates the series using a mathematical formula.

Problem 3: Modified Odd Number Series
Functionality: Produces a sequence of odd numbers based on conditions tied to the input.
Input: A single integer (a).
Output: A series of odd numbers, with the logic modified to account for specific rules tied to the parity of a.
Implementation: The function generate_modified_series() generates the series using a conditional logic approach.

Problem 4: Counting Multiples in a List
Functionality: Counts the number of elements in a list that are multiples of integers from 1 to 9.
Input: A list of integers.
Output: A dictionary where keys are integers (1 to 9), and values are their respective counts of multiples.
Implementation: The function count_multiples() iterates over the list, checking divisibility for each number.
